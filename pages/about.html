      <h1>What is Traditionalism?</h1>
      <p>
        Traditionalism is a collection of ideas aiming to reestablish a hierarchy of morals, social class, ethics, and
        authority, as well as upholding metaphysical and hermetical values and principles and weaponise them against
        the postmodern globalist order and Liberalism.

          <h2 class="quote"><i>"And hold firmly to the rope of God and do not be divided. Remember God’s favour upon you
              when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so you—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at
              the brink of a fiery pit and He saved you from it. This is how God makes His revelations clear to you, so

            obligations within a society</p>
          <h2 class="quote"><i>"O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for God even if it is against
              yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, God is best to ensure their
              interests. So do not let your desires cause you to deviate from justice. If you distort the testimony or
              refuse to give it, then know that God is certainly All-Aware of what you do."</i><a class="greenlink"
